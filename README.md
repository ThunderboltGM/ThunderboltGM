I'm a passionate 3rd-year student pursuing Computer Science, eager to explore the realms of technology and innovation. My journey so far has equipped me with solid skills in languages like C, C++, and Python, as well as in Kali Linux. I believe in leveraging these skills to create meaningful projects that solve real-world problems and contribute positively to the tech community.
